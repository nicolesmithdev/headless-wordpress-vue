For this project you need both the front-end and back-end running at the same time. You will also need a client key for Gravity Forms.

## Backend

-   In the `admin` folder, rename `.env.sample` to `.env`
-   Generate a Gravity Forms API key inside WP-Admin > Forms > Settings > Rest API
-   Add your keys to `admin/.env`
